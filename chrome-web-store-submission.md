## üåê Host Permission Justification

**Host Permission:** `<all_urls>`

**Justification:**
The extension requires host permission for all URLs because users expect the link modification functionality to work consistently across every website they visit. The extension needs to inject a content script that can:

1. **Detect all link elements** (`<a>` tags) on any webpage
2. **Add event listeners** to intercept click events on these links
3. **Modify link behavior** to open in new background tabs instead of the current tab
4. **Handle dynamically loaded content** on single-page applications and AJAX-heavy sites

Without broad host permissions, the extension would only work on pre-defined websites, which would severely limit its utility and create an inconsistent user experience. The functionality is purely client-side and does not send any data to external servers.

**Security Measures:**
- No data extraction or transmission
- Only modifies link target behavior locally
- Uses minimal DOM interaction
- Implements proper event handling with security attributes (`noopener noreferrer`)

## üíª Remote Code Justification

**Remote Code Use:** This extension does NOT use any remote code.

**Justification:**
This extension does not load, execute, or fetch any remote code from external sources. All extension functionality is contained within the packaged extension files:

- **content.js**: Static content script bundled with the extension
- **background.js**: Static service worker bundled with the extension  
- **popup.js**: Static popup script bundled with the extension

**No Remote Dependencies:**
- No external JavaScript libraries loaded from CDNs
- No remote API calls or external service connections
- No dynamic code fetching or evaluation
- No external resources loaded at runtime

**Code Verification:**
All code is static, reviewable, and packaged within the extension ZIP file submitted to the Chrome Web Store. The extension operates entirely offline using only the bundled JavaScript files.

If Chrome Web Store is detecting potential remote code usage, this may be a false positive due to the extension's ability to interact with web content, but all execution happens locally with pre-packaged code only.

## üéØ Single Purpose Description

**Primary Purpose:** Automatically open all clicked links in new background tabs while keeping the user on their current page.

**Detailed Explanation:**
This extension serves one specific purpose: to modify the default link-clicking behavior so that all links open in new background tabs instead of navigating away from the current page. This allows users to stay focused on their current content while collecting links to read later, improving browsing productivity and workflow efficiency.

The extension does not perform any other functions beyond this core link modification behavior and providing a simple toggle to enable/disable this functionality.

## üîë Permission Justifications

### 1. "activeTab" Permission

**What it does:** Allows the extension to access and modify the currently active webpage
**Why needed:** Required to detect and modify link elements (`<a>` tags) on the current page to change their target behavior
**How it's used:** The content script uses this permission to find all links on the page and add event listeners that prevent default navigation and instead open links in new tabs

### 2. "storage" Permission

**What it does:** Allows the extension to save settings locally on the user's device
**Why needed:** Required to remember the user's preference for whether the extension is enabled or disabled
**How it's used:** Stores a single boolean value (extensionEnabled: true/false) that persists between browser sessions, so the user doesn't have to re-enable the extension every time they start Chrome

### 3. "tabs" Permission

**What it does:** Allows the extension to create and manage browser tabs
**Why needed:** Required to programmatically create new background tabs when links are clicked
**How it's used:** The background script uses chrome.tabs.create() with {active: false} to open new tabs in the background without switching focus from the current tab

### Host Permission: "<all_urls>"

**What it does:** Allows the extension to run on all websites
**Why needed:** Users expect the extension to work on every website they visit
**How it's used:** The content script needs to modify link behavior across all websites to provide consistent functionality regardless of the domain
